# Heart-Disease-Machine-Learning-Prediction-Model
Zhihong (George)Li zhihongli@bennington.edu ------  This project intends to find the one of the best ML models for predicting whether a patient has heart disease. If the patient has heart disease, the model will retuen 1, if the patient does not have heart disease, the model will return 0. This project has two parts. 



Part 1: Heart_Disease_Machine_Learning_Prediction_Model   
Part 2: Shuffle_Data_Ten_Times_and_Evaluate_Model.
